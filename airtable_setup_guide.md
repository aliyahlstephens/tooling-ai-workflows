## Step 6: Test the Setup

### Add Sample Data:

3. Use the sample data from `sample_data.json` as a reference

### Test the Automation:
1. Set up your `.env` file with the API keys
2. Run the compression script:
   ```bash
   python main.py compress --applicant-id YOUR_TEST_ID
   ```
3. Verify the compressed JSON appears in the Applicants table

## Step 7: Configure Automation (Optional)

### Set up Airtable Automations:

2. **Action**: Run compression script
3. **Trigger**: Compressed JSON updated
4. **Action**: Run LLM evaluation
5. **Trigger**: LLM evaluation complete
6. **Action**: Run shortlist evaluation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Field Name Mismatches**
   - Ensure field names exactly match those in `config.py`
   - Check for extra spaces or special characters

2. **API Permission Errors**
   - Verify your personal access token has the correct scopes
   - Check that the base ID is correct
   - Ensure the token hasn't expired

3. **Link Field Issues**
   - Ensure all "Applicant ID" fields are properly linked
   - Test the links by creating sample records

4. **Date Format Issues**
   - Use YYYY-MM-DD format for all dates
   - Leave end dates empty for current positions
